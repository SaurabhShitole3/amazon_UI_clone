Using "font awesome" for fonts in website

using "cdn" i.e content delivery network 

what is cdn:
Imagine you're at a party and you want some snacks. Instead of going all the way to the kitchen every time you want a snack,
 the party host puts snack stations in different rooms throughout the house.
 These snack stations have the same snacks as the kitchen, so you can get them quickly without walking far.

In this analogy:

You are the internet user.
The kitchen is the original website where the content (like images, videos, etc.) is stored.
The snack stations are the servers in the Content Delivery Network (CDN).
The party host is the website owner who uses the CDN to make sure you get the content faster.
So, instead of fetching content from the original website every time, the CDN brings the content closer to you, making the internet faster and more efficient.
